# pandas-challenge

This challenge is to analyze data from a hypothetical school district to help make strategic decisions regarding future school budgets and priorities.

Repository contains a folder called 'PyCitySchools' which will contain three specific items:

   - a subfolder called 'Resources' which will contain the raw data from the schools and students used for analysis
   - an Jupyter Notebook file named 'PyCitySchools_final.ipynb' where we will import, clean, and perform analysis on the raw data to better understand it
   - a summary write up on the results determined from the analysis done in 'PyCitySchools_final.ipynb'
